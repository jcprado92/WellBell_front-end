          The problem - People are neglecting physical and mental health while
          working remotely. Having reminders to incorporate movement, having a
          snack or just close their eyes for a moment can make a huge
          difference.
          <br />
          By adding mindfulness and wellness activities WellBell can help
          improve the mental health and general happiness factor of people
          working from home!
